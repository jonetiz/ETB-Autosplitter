## ~~Known Issues (2.3/2.9 ONLY)~~ As of 3/22/2024 these issues should not be present
~~- Level 94 Town -> Level 94 Clown does not split in load screen for some reason in singleplayer 2.9~~
~~- Ending is inconsistent, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't~~
~~- Some users may find the autosplitter does not work; this seems to have something to do with OS version.~~
